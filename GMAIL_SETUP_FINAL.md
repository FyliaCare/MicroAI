# ✅ Gmail SMTP Setup - Final Configuration

## 🎯 Current Status

**Email Provider:** Gmail SMTP (No SendGrid, No Outlook)
**Gmail Account:** microailabsglobal@gmail.com
**Sends To:** microailabs@outlook.com (your inbox)

---

## ✅ What's Already Done

1. ✅ Code updated to use Gmail SMTP
2. ✅ All SendGrid references removed
3. ✅ All Outlook references removed
4. ✅ Environment variables set in Render:
   - `SMTP_HOST = smtp.gmail.com`
   - `SMTP_PORT = 587`
   - `SMTP_USER = microailabsglobal@gmail.com`
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD = Blacktyre321`

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gmail App Password Required

**IMPORTANT:** The password `Blacktyre321` in Render is your **regular Gmail password**.  
For SMTP to work, you need a **Gmail App Password** instead!

### Why App Password?

Gmail blocks "less secure apps" from using regular passwords for security.  
App Passwords are special 16-character codes for apps like yours.

## 🔐 Get Your Gmail App Password (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Enable 2-Step Verification

5. Follow the prompts to enable (you'll use your phone)

### Step 2: Create App Password

1. After 2FA is enabled, go back to: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Find **"App passwords"** (it will appear after 2FA is enabled)
3. Click **"App passwords"**
4. You might need to sign in again
5. Select:
   - **Select app:** Other (Custom name)
   - **Name it:** `MicroAI Website`
6. Click **"Generate"**
7. **COPY the 16-character password** (looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 3: Update Render Environment Variable

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-cto7hrtsvqrc738k60vg
2. Click **"Environment"** tab
3. Find `SMTP_PASSWORD`
4. **Replace** `Blacktyre321` with your **new 16-character App Password**
5. Click **"Save Changes"**
6. Wait for automatic redeploy (~3 minutes)

## 🚀 Testing After App Password is Set

### Step 1: Wait for Render to Redeploy

Watch the Render dashboard until you see:
```
==> Your service is live 🎉
==> Available at your primary URL https://microai-8gl3.onrender.com
```

### Step 2: Test Contact Form

1. Go to: https://microai-8gl3.onrender.com/contact
2. Fill out the form with your test email
3. Click "Send Message"

### Step 3: Check Render Logs

Go to Render → Logs tab and look for:

**✅ SUCCESS:**
```
✅ Email sent successfully to microailabs@outlook.com
✅ Auto-reply confirmation sent to client: [email]
Contact form submission: { name, email, message }
```

**❌ FAIL (if still using regular password):**
```
❌ Email sending error: Invalid login
```

### Step 4: Check Your Inbox

- Check `microailabs@outlook.com` for notification email
- Check your test email for auto-reply confirmation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid login" error?
