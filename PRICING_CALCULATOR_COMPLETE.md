## 🎓 How It Works (Technical)

### Algorithm Flow
```typescript
1. Start with base package cost
2. Add feature costs (setup + monthly)
3. Calculate extra page costs (if applicable)
4. Calculate user scaling costs (if applicable)
5. Apply timeline multiplier
6. Generate ±15% range for setup
7. Generate ±10% range for monthly
8. Display with USD → GHS conversion (×15)
```

### State Management
```typescript
useState hooks for:
- projectType: 'website' | 'webTool' | 'webApp' | 'saas'
- features: string[] (array of selected features)
- timeline: 'urgent' | 'normal' | 'flexible'
- pageCount: number (3-50)
- userCount: number (10-1000)
- estimate: object (calculated results)
```

### Real-time Updates
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  calculateEstimate()
}, [projectType, features, timeline, pageCount, userCount])
// Recalculates whenever any input changes
```
