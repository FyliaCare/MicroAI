```
==> Your service is live 🎉
```

### Test Contact Form:

1. Go to: https://microai-8gl3.onrender.com/contact
2. Fill out form
3. Submit
4. Check Render logs for:
   ```
   📧 Attempting to send email via Resend API...
   ✅ Email sent successfully via Resend! ID: xxx
   ✅ Auto-reply sent via Resend! ID: yyy
   ```

5. Check `microailabs@outlook.com` inbox
6. Check test email inbox for auto-reply

## 🎯 What Success Looks Like

### Render Logs (GOOD):
```
📧 Attempting to send email via Resend API...
Resend Config: {
  hasApiKey: true,
  from: 'MicroAI <onboarding@resend.dev>',
  to: 'microailabs@outlook.com'
}
✅ Email sent successfully via Resend! ID: 1a2b3c4d
✅ Auto-reply sent via Resend! ID: 5e6f7g8h
Contact form submission: { name, email, message }
```

### Render Logs (BAD):
```
❌ Resend API error: Missing API key
```
**Fix:** Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Render environment

## 📊 Environment Variables Summary

### Required:
```
PORT = 10000
RESEND_API_KEY = re_your_actual_api_key_here
```
